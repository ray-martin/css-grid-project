JCCC Web 122 Midterm Project on CSS Grid System
https://ray-martin.github.io/css-grid-project/index.html

This assignment was to create one page style webpage that taught about flexbox or grid and was responsive across
different viewport sizes. I chose to focus on Grid and used anchor tags for the Nav to different areas of the page
as well as the Named Method for defining the grid and changing the layout based on the size of screen.
